# btfoiuthns.exe-Malware
Long C++ malware with 16 payloads lasting 8 minutes.<br> For educational purposes only.<br> Not for epileptics.<br> Works in Windows XP-11<br>
This is probably my last malware, because I am going to get busy with irl stuff soon and GDI is getting boring in 2023 (for the OGs)
